# Nonlinear Dynamics in Biological Co-evolution
#### Duration: September'21 to November'21
Analyzed, interpreted, and recreated results of a paper on the application of the Replicator Equations in
studying nonlinear behaviour and Bifurcation Theory for biological co-evolution of three species. Simulated the nonlinear Phase Space behaviour of the three co-evolving species populations using numerical
methods to solve the replicator equations (differential equations) and plotted it using Python.
##### Relevant Skills: Theoretical understanding of Nonlinear Dynamics, plotting and solving differential equations numerically using Python

#### Group Members:
Aryaman, Bhavya, Devashish, Sagnik, Samyak

Comment: I have uploaded the final report of the project containing the link to a GitHub repo containing the codes written.
